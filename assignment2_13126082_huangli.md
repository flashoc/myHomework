----------------------------

In the second week we have learned three chapters of "Software Quality Engineering". These chapters mainly talk about quality assurance in context, software quality engineering and software testing. 

### Chapter 4. QA in Context

This chapter focuses on the topics of quality assurance in context, which include defect handling, QA in software processes and v&v perspective. It points out and explained the difference between defect view and verification&validation view. How to measure and analysis defect also have been talked about.

There are some software processes, QA is important in all processes. QA in waterfall process is a good example. Waterfall development process include requirement, specification, design, coding, testing, release. QA is exist in all phase of it. In the phase of requirements analysis, design and coding, it focus on defect prevention. In the phase of testing, it focus on defect removal. And in the phase of release and support, it focus on defect containment.

### Chapter 5. Quality Engineering

This chapter gives an overview of software quality engineering, include key activities in SQE and how SQE play in Software Process. SQE play an important role in the software process, Firstly setting quality goals, Secondly selecting the measurements&models, thirdly doing analysis if the quality goals is satisfied. in Software Processes SQE activities are part of development activities, quality planning is part of product planning, QA activities are part of development activities and analysis/feedback is part of project management. 

### Chapter 6. Testing Overview

This chapter provides an overview of software testing. Software testing methods are traditionally divided into white- and black-box testing. White-box testing tests internal structures or workings of a program. Black-box testing treats the software as a "black box", examining functionality without any knowledge of internal implementation.

Actual client usage of software may be considered as a form of usage-based testing. In the case if defects are detected by clients, some information about them can be reported to software vendors, and integrated fixes may be created and delivered to all the clients to avert such defects.

Systematic testing is ordered, planned, and testing designed to be purposefully methodical in its approach. It requires an in-depth analysis of the application and the application's components at a very granular level. Some systematic testing approaches include equivalence class partitioning, boundary value analysis, combinatorial analysis, state transition testing, basis path testing, etc.
